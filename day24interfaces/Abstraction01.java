        "final" keyword is very important in Java
            1)"final" keyword can be used for variables
              public final int age = 12;
              If you make a variable "final" you cannot change its value
              "final variables" must be initialized.

            2)"final" keyword can be used for methods
              "final method" body cannot be updated

            3)"final" keyword can be used for classes
              "final classes" cannot have child classes

        Note: "abstract classes" have something to do for child classes, if there is no child class, having "to do list" is not sensible.
              "final classes" cannot have child classes, therefore Java does not allow to make an abstract class final.

        Note:  "final method" body will be under protection by Java, because it should not be updated.
               But abstract methods don't have body, Java will look for the body to protect when it could not find it will complain
