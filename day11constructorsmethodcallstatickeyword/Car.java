    /*
        When you create a class you will use it to create an object most probably, Java knows it.
        Because of that when you create a class Java puts "constructor" in it automatically, its name is "Default Constructor"
        "Default Constructor"s are invisible.

        If you create your own constructor, Java deletes the "Default Constructor"
     */

//How to create "constructor"
//Note: Constructor name must match with the class name
//What is the difference between "Constructors" and "Methods"
//Note 1: Constructors do not have "return type" but methods have
//Note 2: Constructor name must match with the class name but method name can be any name
//Note 3: Constructors are used to create objects but methods are used to create some actions

//Note: If any class you want to use, is in the same package no need to import.
//      But if the class is in the different package, you have to import it.
