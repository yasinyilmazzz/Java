    /*
        1)What is the difference between "default" and "protected" access modifiers?
            i)"protected" access modifier is wider than "default" modifier
            ii)"default" ones cannot be used from outside the package, therefore it's other name is "package private"
               "protected" ones can be used form the class in other packages if the classes are "child classes"

        2)Could you please tell the name of the access modifiers from the narrowest to the widest?
             private < default < protected < public

        3)Could you please explain all access modifiers?
