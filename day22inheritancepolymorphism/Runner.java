         a) If the parent class has multiple constructors by the help of the parameters you can select any cons.
         b) Typing "super()" is optional but if you use super() with parameters you have to type them.
         c) super() must be in the first line in constructor body
         d) super() can be used just once in a constructor body
         2) this() is used to call constructors from the class itself.
           a) If the parent class has multiple constructors by the help of the parameters you can select any cons.
         b) Typing "this()" is not optional you have to type it with or without parameters.
         c) this() must be in the first line in constructor body
         d) this() can be used just once in a constructor body
         Note: this() and super() can not be used together in the same constructor body

        3)"super" keyword is used to select any variable or any method from parent class
          "this" keyword is used to select any variable or any method from the class itself
          Note: What is the difference between "this" and "this()"?
             "this" is used to call variable or methods,
             "this()" is used to call constructors from the class itself
         Note: What is the difference between "super" and "super()"?
             "super" is used to call variable or methods,
             "super()" is used to call constructors from the parent class

             Note:1)When we call a variable in a parent-child relationship, we need to check the data type of the object.
            Note:2)When we call a method in a parent-child relationship, we need to check the constructor of object.
            Note:3)There is "IS-A" relationship from child class to parent class...
            Note:4)There is "HAS-A" relationship from parent class to child class...
            Note:5)If there is no parent-child relationship you cannot have "IS-A" or "HAS-A" relationship.


           To be able to use overriding we need to create parent-child rela
           Without inheritance overriding is impossible
           ***What is the prerequisite of overriding?==>Interview question
           It is inheritance.

           eat(); is common for all. If a cat eat()==>sout==>Animals eat.
                                     If that cat feed()==> sout==>(In mammal class)feed ()==>"Mammals feed their babies with their milk."

            When we talk about cats we should tell "Cat" not "Animal" or "Mammal".

            Using "Animal" or "Mammal" is not wrong but not good. We should update eat() like "Cat eats" not "Animal eat".

           Updating a method after getting parent class is called "METHOD OVERRIDING". To make a general method a specific method is called "method overriding".

           Access modifiers of overriding is same no problem.
           but if private acc. mod. no relation/inheritance. Private acces modifier can not be inherited.

                   protected    XXX public XXX

                   Access modifier of "Overriding Method" child class can not be narrower than the access modifier of "Overridden Method".
                   Parents' must be narrower.
                   Return type should not narrower than the parents return type.

                                                            METHOD OVERRIDING
            1)When the child classes use the methods from the parent classes, we may need to update implementation of the methods.
              For example; in Animal class eat() method tells "Animals eat", but to tell "Animals eat" in Cat class is not good.
              To be able to create specific implementation for the Cat class like "Cats eat" we should update the method body.
              This is called "Method Overriding"
            2)To do "Method Overriding" we need "inheritance". If there is no "inheritance" it means there is no "Method Overriding".
            3)When we use "Method Overriding", we do not touch to the "Method Signature"(Method Name + Parameters)
            4)"@Override" annotation checks the "Overriding Rules" when you do "Overriding"
            5)When you do "Method Overriding", you cannot use "Narrower" access modifiers in child class,
              you can use same or wider access modifiers.
            6)When you do "Method Overriding", the method in parent class is called "Overridden Method",
              the method in child class is called "Overriding Method"
            7)When you do "Method Overriding", if the return type is "void" in "Overridden Method",
              return type of the "Overriding Method" must be "void"
            8)When you do "Method Overriding", return type of the "Overriding Method" can be same or the child
              of the return type of the "Overridden Method"
              From child return type to parent type you must have "IS-A" Relationship
            9)Between the Wrapper Classes, Java did not create "Parent-Child Relationship", therefore
              between the Wrapper Classes there is no "IS-A" relationship. If there is no "IS-A" Relationship
              you cannot change the return types in "Method Overriding"
            10)When you do "Method Overriding", if the return type of the "Overridden Method" is "primitive"
              you cannot change it in "Method Overriding" because "primitive" data types are not classes
              if they are not classes you cannot have "IS-A" relationship.

              Note: If a method is final, it means its body cannot be updated.

            11)Body of a "final method" cannot be updated, because in Overriding we change the method
              body, but final methods do not allow us to change the body

            12)"private" methods cannot be overridden, because to override a method we have to access
              to it. "private" methods are not accessible from other classes

            13)"static" methods cannot be overridden because "static" things are common for
              all child classes, if any child class updates the static method body other child classes
              will be effected as well, therefore Java does not let you override a static method.
